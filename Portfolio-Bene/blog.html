                        Jumping Spiders make an entertaining and easy pet for anyone!
                        They are inquisitive and non-aggressive, so it makes handling them super easy.
                        Not to mention, they're adorable, so even people with a fear of spiders will find a soft spot for these little guys.
                        All you need is an enclosure, and a steady supply of small bugs.
                        I've had mine for just over 5 months, and she is such a wonderful little character.

                        Whilst on a trip to Japan last year, before travelling was thrown out the window,
                        I was lucky enough to go to a Shiba Cafe!<br>
                        I was absolutely over the moon, as the Shiba Inu is one of my favourite dog breeds.
                        <br>For half an hour you get to sit in a room with about 10 Shiba dogs and let me tell you, it is pure bliss.
                        <br>If you are even half as much of a dog fan as me, I can't recommend one of these places enough!

                        I don't know about you, but somehow I always leave it until the very last minute to make gifts for my friends and family. 
                        While this is stressful, it has lead to a number of excellent gift ideas I would probably not have come across otherwise. 
                        <br>One of these is going to your local op-shop, finding an old framed landscape painting, and taking it home to paint on. 
                        I have done quite a few of these now, and every one has turned out awesome!
                        The one pictured here is one I made with a quote from Oscar Wilde for my mother; as she is a big fan, but there are many options to what you could paint on it.
                        My personal favourite is to paint Studio Ghibli characters into Australian landscapes.<br> Need to get someone a gift? Why not give it a go!

                        This is my little cat Baron, I have had him since he was 5 weeks old and he and I are best mates!<br>
                        His favourite pastimes include; play fighting, sleeping, eating, drinking out of my cup, climbing trees and running up and down the stairs in the middle of the night.<br>
                        He is a softie at heart and has never successfully killed anything, not even a butterfly. I hope you enjoy him as much as I do!

                        DND is a great way to have fun with your friends, what makes it even more fun is if you can show off your fancy character to everyone else. 
                        <br>During lockdown my partner and our friends decided to create DND characters, going the extra mile and drawing them was optional but I am so glad I did!
                        <br>It's a lot of fun to think about what your characters outfit or accessories might be, and a good way to kill time if you're bored in lockdown like we were! 
                        My character is a Tabaxi Rogue named Seven Bite.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
