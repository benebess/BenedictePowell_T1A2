            <h2>Poster Design for live bands</h2>
            <p>During lockdown last year I got back into photoshop and tried my hand at designing posters.
                I tried all sorts of things while getting some practise, including even making mock movie posters with my friends on them in place of celebrities!
                When the live music venue I worked at reopened and I went back to work, I noticed a lot of bands that played lacked a poster, noticing this 
                gap, I decided to offer to make one for a band that had a gig coming up! It went really well and now I do it on the regular! 
                I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and don't see myself stopping anytime soon!

            <h2>Portfolio Website!</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying at Coder Academy and for our second assignment we were required to make this portfolio website.
               I have learnt a lot in the few weeks I have been at Coder and I've put just about all of that knowledge to use in this website.
               I hope you enjoy having a look around, and don't hesitate to reach out via the contact page. I don't bite :)
