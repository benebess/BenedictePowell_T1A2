## PURPOSE OF MY PORTFOLIO:

The purpose of my Portfolio Website is to showcase to prospective employers who I am, a little about what I am like and what I can do.

## FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES:

The features of my site include 5 HTML pages, all styled in a seperate CSS stylesheet, a simple nav bar along the top of each page and a floating footer at the bottom of each page. The footer includes icon links to my socials that grow when hovered over & a copyright. 
The contact page also includes these icon links as well as a "mailto" link that opens in whatever email program the user has set to default. 
The homepage is a simple landing page with my name and a short subheading explaining what I do. The about page has a photo of me, a blurb, a link to download my resume and a list of my skills all displayed as icons. On most pages I have made the images circles as it compliments my theme and gives the image a nice feel. The only page that doesn't feature this is the projects page and that is because I felt it displayed the images better as mostly a square with a slight rounded edge to keep to the theme. The blog page has an image, titles, dates and a small paragraph for each post, I kept this page simple and easy to read. The projects page is very straightforward and as I mentioned I kept the images a less rounded to really show my work.
